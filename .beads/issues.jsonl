{"id":"arcfusion-avc","title":"Validation: Can we discover Transformer without the attention paper?","description":"## Research Question\n\nIf the \"Attention Is All You Need\" paper had never been published, could ArcFusion's dream engine independently discover the Transformer architecture by composing components from other papers?\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nThis is a key validation of the entire ArcFusion approach:\n- If YES → The system can genuinely discover novel architectures\n- If NO → We're just recombining known patterns, not innovating\n\n## Experiment Design\n\n### Setup\n1. Remove Transformer and all attention-related components from the database\n2. Seed only with pre-2017 components (RNNs, CNNs, LSTMs, embeddings, etc.)\n3. Add components from papers that influenced attention (memory networks, seq2seq, etc.)\n\n### Test\n1. Run dream engine with various strategies (greedy, random, crossover, mutate)\n2. Generate many candidate architectures\n3. Analyze: Do any resemble Transformer's key innovations?\n   - Multi-head attention pattern\n   - Encoder-decoder with cross-attention\n   - Positional encodings + self-attention (no recurrence)\n\n### Success Criteria\n- **Strong success**: Dream engine produces attention-like mechanism\n- **Partial success**: Produces components that could lead to attention with minor tweaks\n- **Failure**: Only produces RNN/CNN variants\n\n## Dependencies\n- Robust component extraction from pre-2017 papers\n- Good relationship scoring between components\n- Multiple dream strategies working well\n\n## Notes\n- This may require ingesting more historical papers (2014-2016 era)\n- May need to tune dream engine parameters\n- Could be a good benchmark for measuring system improvement over time","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-11T14:19:39.83596-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-11T14:19:39.83596-08:00"}
{"id":"arcfusion-ayd","title":"Track component configurations (sub-architectures)","description":"## Problem\n\nCurrently we track full engines (e.g., Transformer with 15 components) but not successful sub-configurations. For example, if 7 specific components from Transformer in a certain order consistently produce good results, we have no way to capture and reuse that pattern.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nTrack \"configurations\" - ordered subsets of components that work well together:\n\n### New DB Table: `component_configurations`\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE component_configurations (\n    config_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n    name TEXT,                          -- e.g., \"Transformer Core Block\"\n    description TEXT,\n    component_ids TEXT,                 -- JSON array of component IDs in order\n    source_engine_id TEXT,              -- Engine this was derived from (optional)\n    configuration_score REAL,           -- How well this config performs\n    usage_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,      -- How often used in dreams\n    validated BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0,        -- Has been tested/validated\n    created_at TIMESTAMP\n);\n```\n\n### Key Features\n1. **Configuration extraction**: Analyze engines to find common successful patterns\n2. **Configuration scoring**: Track which configs produce good dream results\n3. **Dream integration**: Use proven configs as building blocks for new architectures\n4. **Configuration discovery**: Find configs that appear across multiple engines\n\n### Use Cases\n- \"Attention + LayerNorm + FFN\" block appears in many architectures → track as config\n- User validates a dreamed architecture → extract and save its sub-configs\n- Dream engine prefers using proven configs when available\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Add `component_configurations` table to schema\n- [ ] Add CRUD operations for configurations\n- [ ] Add method to extract configs from existing engines\n- [ ] Integrate with composer to prefer known-good configs\n- [ ] CLI commands: `arcfusion config list/show/extract`","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-11T14:17:56.139247-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-11T14:18:07.014711-08:00"}
